# WorldQuant University - Applied-Data-Science-Lab
I have earned the Applied Data Science Lab badge after I have completed eight end-to-end, applied data science projects. 
In each project, I have accessed data from files, SQL and NoSQL databases and APIs. I have explored and cleaned data, created functions and ETL pipelines to prepare training sets. They have built machine learning models for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, and have created visualizations to explain data characteristics and model predictions for non-technical audiences.
